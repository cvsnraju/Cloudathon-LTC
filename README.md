## Idea

1. OpenTofu: This is a tool that helps automate the setup of infrastructure. Think of it as a way to quickly and consistently set up the computer systems you need.
2. Templates: These are predefined blueprints that describe how your infrastructure should be set up.
Using templates ensures that every setup is consistent and follows the same rules.
3. Parallel Environments: You'll create multiple environments that can run different technologies (like Java or Nodejs) at the same time. This is useful for testing and development purposes.
4. Base Images: These are the starting points for setting up your infrastructure. Automating the selection of these images means you can quickly choose the right setup for your needs without manual intervention.
5. Build Pipeline: This is a series of automated steps that take your code, prepare it, and deploy it to the environments you've set up. It ensures that your code is consistently and reliably deployed.
Benefits
• Consistency: Using templates and automation ensures that every environment is set up the same way, reducing errors.
• Efficiency: Automating the setup and deployment processes saves time and effort.
• Flexibility: Being able to support different technologies means you can work on various projects simultaneously.
